Contributing components to nf-core involves developing modular, reusable pipeline elements that adhere to community guidelines for standardization and quality.
These components, such as individual analysis tools or process modules, are integrated into pipelines, ensuring consistency and ease of use across projects.
By contributing, you help expand the nf-core ecosystem while promoting reproducibility and collaboration in bioinformatics workflows.

## Contribute to components

nf-core modules and subworkflows are stored in the [`nf-core/modules`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules) repository.
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this repository by adding new or improving existing components.

To contribute to the nf-core modules repository:

<Steps>

1. Fork the [`nf-core/modules`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules) repository to your personal account or organization.
2. Create a new branch using Git or the GitHub GUI:
    - Git: Run `git checkout -b <new component>`. Replace `<new component>` with an informative name for the new/modified component.
    - GUI: Select the top-left dropdown menu and create a new branch. Give the branch an informative name for the new/modified component.
3. Add the new component or modify an existing component.
    - See RELEVANT SECTIONS for more information about component specifications.
4. When your component is ready, make a pull request against the [`nf-core/modules`](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules) repository.
5. Post your pull request in the `#request-review` Slack channel.
    
    <Aside>
    Most contributors don't monitor the modules repository and posting your pull request increases visibility.
    Many contributors like to "trade" reviews.

See RELEVANT SECTIONS for more information about reviewing components.

<Aside type="tip" title="Submit one pull request per component">
Adding or updating multiple components in one pull request can slow approval.
Large pull requests take longer to review and change requests may block changes that would have otherwise been accepted.
