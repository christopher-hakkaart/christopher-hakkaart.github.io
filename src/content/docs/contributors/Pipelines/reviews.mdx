Pipeline release reviews can be daunting, especially for those tackling them for the first time.

Release PRs often encompass diverse changes, making it challenging to establish a strict set of review guidelines compared to modules or subworkflows.

The reviewer's primary role is to ensure the pipeline aligns with nf-core's core principlesâ€”reproducibility, comprehensive reporting, proper documentation, and adherence to the template.

1. Assign yourself to the pull request.
2. Check the pipeline meets the nf-core pipeline guidelines:
    - Nextflow: Workflows must be built using Nextflow.
